Edgar
- How could you possibly believe an empire that has conquered its land fortyfold hold any moral superiority to one such as me who simply wishes to reclaim his rightful place?

Adam
- And yet that place comes at the cost of the livelihood of the caravans your men assault.

Edgar
- And those very caravans are nothing but more weapons to further the conquest your king so loves.

Adam
- You are in no position to judge that right or wrong, the king must fight the Southerners because they are unable to coordinate enough to formulate a treaty, you attack your fellow man for no reason other than personal gain.
Edgar
- No reason? Your kingdom's greed cost me my family, my inheritance and almost my own life! I'm only here today because the king thought it honourable to induct me into the military that ended my family's kingdom. I was paraded as a "Symbol of unity" like a doll in royal clothing. By every way you measure evil the kingdom you defend has surpassed me by leaps and bounds. So make your choice Swordsman. Judge me, but judge this kingdom just as harshly.
