Calixto Fleccia - Grand General of Sancterra - CF
Adam Hoffman - Man with sword - AH

CF - Adam, do you realize the position you've put me in here? Some upstart from the capital decides his sister is more important than winning the war so you go on a rampage south beating each of my generals. That is not conducive to me seeming competent, I hope you realize.

AH - And I hope you realize that my family is more important to me than this war.

CF -  I had hoped beating you would damage you beyond talking.

AH - ...

CF - I can sympathise with protecting family, any true Sancterran can. And I'm fully aware of how the draft feels to the people it affects, it wasn't my first choice either, but we have been here for 10 years with nothing to show for it. Every day the prophecy comes closer, and that damned hero has yet to show anything for it. At this point I am backed into a corner.

AH - Yeah, sure mister-

CF - I'm not done. We cant count on the hero, idealists like you and your little band of colourful merry men don't get that. The hero might be prophesized but he's a person, and a singular person can and will fail. What we need aren't heroes, we need structure, a plan.

Intimidate

AH - You can hold me for as long as you want in this dungeon, you can take your knives and instruments to my flesh but know that I will get out someday, maybe not in body but in spirit, the hero will accomplish his task and you have become a part of the evil that he has sworn to vanquish.

Persuade

AH - I represent that which you want to stop I'm , sure you want order and in your eyes I represent chaos. An ideology or spirit that stops how you think we need to defend ourselves. But this is more than that, I just want to show you that an individual can suffer in the place of thousands to you.
