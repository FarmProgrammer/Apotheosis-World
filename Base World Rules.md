Humanity is born with 2 crystals, one which reveals during puberty and another that can be infused with different man made elements.
Humanity or [[Servin]] as they are known in this world have another organ surrounding their heart that filters impurities out of their blood similarly to kidneys, these however exist to clear trace amounts of magic from their system.
At maturity enough magic accumulates at the crystal to show what magic that individual is less capable of processing giving colour to the crystal. The secondary Crystal acts as a guide for the organ around the heart to indicate it on how to refine the magic.

[[Aral]] on the other hand have a single crystal on their forehead, larger than that of the servin, allowing them to draw upon greater reserves of magic at the cost of not being able to refine how the magic is processed.
