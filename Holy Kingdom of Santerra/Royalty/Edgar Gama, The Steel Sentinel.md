Moveset:
Edgar has a stagger meter that when it reaches 100 his stance breaks allowing the player to get big hits in but decays over time.
Phase 1:
	Edgar, still underestimating Adam as just some stronger than average guy tries to focus more on his physical advantage and presses the attack with blades.
		Weapon modes:
			- Whip: Very Fast mid range attacks that have to be sequence parried, parried whip attacks add 10 to his stagger meter.
			- Sword: Fast close attacks that hurt a lot more than the whip but require less sequence parries to disable Edgar, parried blade attacks add 40 to his stagger meter.
			- Maul: Slow but high damage attacks with a deceiving wind up, parried maul attacks add 100 to Edgar's stagger meter 
		Steel Wall:
			If the player gets too far from Edgar he will summon a steel wall behind the player that does damage if the player is on it when it comes out of the ground.
		Magnetic Pull:
			Edgar will occasionally pull the player in unless he dodges and then begin a flurry of attacks.
		Earth Rupture:
			Indicators appear on the ground before spikes rupture forth damaging the player, if the player parries the spikes Edgar's stance will be broken.
		
Phase 2:
	Edgar covers the arena in metal and focuses more on his skill as a mage over his physicality.
		Shrapnel Shield:
			Edgar will periodically summon steel fragments to float around him and prevent the player from getting close. He can maintain this only for a relatively short period before he explodes the shield in an undogeable attack that can only be parried. Parrying it damages Edgar as fragments are sent back to him.
		Earth Rupture:
			Indicators appear on the ground before spikes rupture forth damaging the player, if the player parries the spikes Edgar's stance will be broken. If Edgar is in his shrapnel shield his shield will dissipate.
		Magnetic Slam:
			Edgar summons chunks of steel that he will throw at Adam causing shockwaves where they hit the metallic ground.
		Steel Golems:
			Edgar shapes steel into living constructs that physically attack the player, Edgar can only use this if he is only focusing on Shrapnel shield as it is difficult to concentrate on.
