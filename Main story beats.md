	- After defeating the bandits Adam faces their leader [[Edgar Gama]] and must choose to either kill him or allow him to continue to roam the countryside assaulting military supply carts.
	- Adam returns to the city and makes preparations to search for the hero to assist him so he can put an end to the need of the war. To this end many of his friends either agree to help him or choose to follow him heedless of his protests.

In this city despite previous encounters with generals and military officials due to a large armed group travelling the countryside with a draftee Adam comes face to face with [[Calixto Fleccia]]. After and ambush and a close but ultimately lost fight between Adam and Calixto in a military labour camp Adam is kicked into the rushing waters of a canyon only to wake in the Badlands. After making first contact with the [[Aral]] Adam finds a local tribe chief and duels him to ask for information regarding the hero believing him to be the only way for him to recover his now imprisoned friends. The chief points Adam to a road leaving [[Lann]] that passes near his tribe's territory in [[Pheophraw]].
	- Walking near this road Adam spots a military supply vehicle from [[Lann]] as it is attacked by what appears to be 5 [[Aral]] by dress but Adam notices they lack the distinct forehead crystal. Following them back from the attacked cart Adam comes across a secluded valley in the Badlands with a palace in its centre and watches as the 5 bandits remove their helmets to reveal themselves as the hero's party. An outraged Adam enters the palace to search for the hero only to find a man consumed by ambitions of greed and riches. After a fight the hero reveals that his position and his prophecy were manufactured by the king to unite the people behind the figurehead and the Aral have no actual intent of plunging the world into chaos. At least the majority of them. As the heroes party rush to assist the hero Adam is forced to retreat and Journeys to [[Avenny]] to speak to [[Aíne Avenny]], the current head of the tribes. After a duel Aíne chooses to join Adam on his quest along with a handful of Aral warriors to march on the secluded palace.

But the idea of his friends and sister being held captive spur him to act.

	- Returning to [[Tavapinhas]] Adam, Aíne and Calixto confront the king. His scheme had been to use the portal to [[The World Beyond]] to allow malicious entities to leak out and subsequently manufacturing a prophecy and hero to combat those same entities as the kign believes that the only way for his people to be truly united is with a single common enemy, which is why the king blamed these entities on the Aral.
	- In a battle against the King as a final desperate act he Unseals the portal and allows both worlds to begin to meld and many entities to escape and pulling Adam [[The World Beyond]]. Both Calixto and Aíne are capable and know how to seal the portal again but they are reluctant to do so while Adam is within it, ultimately choosing to seal it once more while Tavapinhas is burning as they believe it is what he would have wanted.
	- As Adam wanders [[The World Beyond]] tirelessly his blade seems to guide him to a light and upon reaching it he wakes in a familiar windmill as [[the old lady]] cleans the sword.
