Ad-Look Albert, I'm telling you, ice wyrms are real, we hunted them back in Buruma!

Al-Sure sure, so these massive beasts that can breathe elements better than any crystal elementalist are real, but somehow you hunt them?

-Yeah, we do, I could say the same about those beasts in Penagoas, not only do we BOTH know those exist but you madmen hunt them ON BOATS! At least we make dragons land so we can fight them with the earth under us!

-Ok, ill concede, we hunt some scary things sometimes, but at least those things ain't getting out of wherever they live, dragons ain't like waterbeasts, waterbeasts stick to the water, dragons would stick to wherever they damn well please!

-Once I make it in the crystal business ill take you to see one of those hunts, until then beer works just fine to let us see weird stuff.
